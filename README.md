# NinjaScanner signatures (free)

These are signatures for [NinjaScanner](https://nintechnet.com/ninjascanner/) that I have created and which I provide for free and without any support.

## Installation

* copy the `.sig` files into `wp-content/ninjascanner/local`
* go to `wp-admin/admin.php?page=NinjaScanner&nscantab=settings`
* click `Advanced Users Settings`at the bottom
* enable the signatures under `Anti-malware signatures`
* click `Save Settings` at the bottom

See the [official documentation](https://blog.nintechnet.com/ninjascanner-powerful-antivirus-scanner-for-wordpress/#signatures) for more information.
